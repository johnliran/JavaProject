## 2048
2048 is played on a simple 4×4 grid with tiles of varying colors overlaid that slide smoothly when a player moves them. The game uses the arrow keys (or swipe movements) to move tiles left, right, up, and down. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one. Join the numbers and get to the 2048 tile!

## Maze
The maze is played on a simple M*N grid. Each tile can be either a wall or a pathway for the mouse to moveon.
At the beginning of the game,an A* Algorithm is being ran so the shortest and cheapest way for the mouse to get the cheese is calculated.

The player should get to the cheese in the lowest score that can be acheived, which is the score who'se calculated by the a* Algorithm.
The player can move straight - a move that will cost him 10 points, and diagonal - 15 points. 
Diagonal move also make a shorcut of moves.
