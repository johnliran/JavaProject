{"name":"JavaProject","tagline":"Colman Computer Science Project","body":"## 2048\r\n2048 is played on a simple 4×4 grid with tiles of varying colors overlaid that slide smoothly when a player moves them. The game uses the arrow keys (or swipe movements) to move tiles left, right, up, and down. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one. Join the numbers and get to the 2048 tile! Please read the [JavaDocs](blob/master/javadoc/index.html) for more information.\r\n\r\n## Maze\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nProgrammed by Johnnatan Cohen and Liran Polak.
