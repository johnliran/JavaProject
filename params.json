Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one. Join the numbers and get to the 2048 tile! \r\n\r\n## Maze\r\n* Maze is ...\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
