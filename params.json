The game uses the arrow keys (or swipe movements) to move tiles left, right, up, and down. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. Higher-scoring tiles emit a soft glow. Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Use your arrow keys to move the tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one. Join the numbers and get to the 2048 tile!\r\n\r\n## Maze\r\nThe maze is played on a simple M*N grid. Each tile can be either a wall or a pathway for the mouse to moveon.\r\nAt the beginning of the game,an A* Algorithm is being ran so the shortest and cheapest way for the mouse to get the cheese is calculated.\r\n\r\nThe player should get to the cheese in the lowest score that can be acheived, which is the score who'se calculated by the a* Algorithm.\r\nThe player can move straight - a move that will cost him 10 points, and diagonal - 15 points. \r\nDiagonal move also make a shorcut of moves.\r\n\r\n\r\n===================================================================\r\n- You can save, quit, and load again whenever you want.\r\n- Developed on a Mac - Compatible to most of the common platforms.\r\n- Both games can be controlled by keyboard arrows or Mouse dragging.\r\n\r\n===================================================================\r\n\r\nProgrammed by Johnnatan Cohen and Liran Polak.
